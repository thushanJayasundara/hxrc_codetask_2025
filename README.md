🔮 Tarot Card Viewer – Enhanced

This is an upgraded Tarot card deck viewer built with React and Three.js, redesigned for a more intuitive, responsive, and visually engaging experience.
It allows users to shuffle and deal cards with interactive animations, bringing a touch of mysticism to modern UI/UX practices.

✅ Completed Enhancements

✨ UI/UX Improvements
	•	Rebuilt the UI using Tailwind CSS for a modern, mobile-first responsive layout.
	•	Improved card spacing, button placement, and grid responsiveness for both mobile and desktop.
	•	Clean, minimalist aesthetic with readable font sizes and intuitive controls.

🔁 Shuffling Logic
	•	Refactored shuffle mechanism to use true randomization with Math.random() and array mutation logic.
	•	Prevents predictable patterns and ensures fairness in every deal.

🃏 Hover Effect on Dealt Cards
	•	Hover animations added via /src/animations/hovercard.js.
	•	Cards slightly animate forward on hover to improve visibility and engagement.
	•	Only applied to dealt cards (not full deck) for clarity.

Aspect	Original App	Enhanced App
Layout	Static, not mobile-friendly	Fully responsive with adaptive card grid
Shuffling Logic	Predictable or minimal	Fully randomized per shuffle

Clarity	Lacked distinction between deck and dealt cards	Clearly separated components with intuitive interactions
Visual Appeal	Basic browser styling	Tailwind-based UI, spacing, and consistent design

🎮 Gamification Ideas (If Given a Full Week)

If allocated a full development week, here are ideas to turn this into a gamified Tarot experience:

1. Daily Draw Challenge
	•	Let users draw a single card daily as part of a “daily energy” prompt.
	•	Include a streak system and personalized card interpretations.

2. Achievement Badges
	•	Unlock badges for actions like “First Shuffle”, “3-Day Streak”, or “Draw Major Arcana”.

3. Card Encyclopedia
	•	Interactive catalog of all Tarot cards with meanings, allowing users to learn as they draw.

4. Shareable Readings
	•	Allow users to share their three-card spreads (Past-Present-Future) via social media or as images.

5. Sound & Visual Effects
	•	Background music, card flip sounds, and subtle particle animations for immersion.

6. User Profiles & Save State
	•	Let users create profiles to save their favorite readings or track progress.
